# Technical_Intenrship_Resume

This repo gives an idea about formatting and content a resume should have for technical internships. I am including the most important sections that technical companies ask for. You can add or remove sections depending upon your use case. However, it is good to fit everything in one page, specially for undergraduate. For graduate students, two page resume can also be acceptable sometimes.
